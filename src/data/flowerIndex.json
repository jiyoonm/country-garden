        "description": "The rose encapsulates Mexico’s powerful influence on country music. Mexico has long offered up some of the driving influences behind country music. Since the early days of cowboys, sounds and themes from Mexican culture have followed country and Americana music into their modern iterations. After all, Texas itself was part of Mexico once.",

            "This rendition of Take Me Home Country Roads emphasizes the fast paced fiddle all throughout the song. In the 1920s, early forms of country music were born out of honky tonk, which was adapted mostly from ragtime but also heavily influenced by Mexican ranchera music, incorporating sounds that are common in mariachi music like stylized violin or fiddle elements, various string instruments, and lots of horns. ",
            "Texas style fiddle playing is an essential part of country music. This method has evolved over hundreds of years and has been influenced by many folks styles that exist in the south including Mexican songs, African American blues, and Czech and German polka. As these groups lived near one another, and played music with one another, they shared their cultural heritage with one another, and in the process formed a new culture. This is reflected in the music of the day.  It's an example of a country classic that features the fiddle. while emphasizing the importance of this sound.",
            "The iconic Western-swing pianist Knocky Parker once described the Texas-swing genre as “a mixture of Mexican mariachi music from the south, with jazz and country strains coming in from the east.” To this day, the Mexican song “El Rancho Grande” is still a go-to for American swing bands, with its boisterous orchestral use of fiddles and trumpets.",
            "Texas is home to numerous different cultural groups and many different musical traditions including Mexican mariachi music as well as American country music. As generations of Mexican Americans have developed their musical styles in Texas, a genre called Tejano or Tex-Mex music emerged.",
            "The romantic concept of the cowboy has been an essential image to country music. The first cowboys in the American Southwest were the vaqueros. The original vaqueros were largely Indigenous Mexican men who were trained to wrangle cattle on horseback. In fact, much of American Western culture, including the boots, the hats, and rodeos come from Mexico and Mexican culture. ",
            "The vaqueros made their way up to Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, and they brought their songs with them. Mexican vaqueros not only influenced the sound of American cowboy music, but the lyrical content as well. A passion for dancing was common among all these groups, and in this heterogeneous society, musical styles and songs flowed freely from one group to another, modifying the old southern rural styles."

Although the subject matters differ, early Hawaiian music and early country music sound fairly similar, both featuring a soft cadence and a warm layering of notes. The steel guitar is one of the most distinctive and timeless sounds in classic country music.",

In the beginning of the revival, most of the interest was in discovering and re-creating the traditional music of America. The bright twangy sound of the steel string guitar was ideal for playing along with folk instruments such as the banjo, mandolin and fiddle at barn dances.",

We wanted to specifically address the current issue of artifacts looted during colonial times being harbored in museums in Europe and Northern America, only for the benefit of audiences in those areas. We imagined a future in which these artifacts no longer belong to one country, but are rather circulated as object of creative commons, for anyone in the world to enjoy.",
